👋 Olá, sou RAFAEL!

I'm a back-end developer with a passion for programming and creating robust systems. My main specialization is in C# and ASP.NET Core, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my web development skills.

🚀Experience:
- Web development with a focus on ASP.NET Core.
- Creating efficient and scalable RESTful APIs.
- Optimizing SQL queries to improve application performance.
- Collaborating in agile teams to create high-quality software solutions.

💼 I'm currently working as a freelancer back-end developer, where I have the opportunity to apply my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core to create solid systems that meet clients' needs.

🌱 I'm always learning and keeping up to date with the latest trends in web development in order to offer the best solutions for the projects I work on.

📫 Shall we connect?
